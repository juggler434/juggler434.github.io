        <p id='date'>January 19, 2015</p><!--date posted goes here-->
        <p>Last time I wrote a blog post was back when I was still in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp.  I've decided that now that I've graduated its time to start this thing up again.</p><!--Main post goes here-->

        <p>The big thing in my life right now is, of course, finding a job.  This task is proving to be a little more daunting than I thought it was going to be; I'm still not really sure what I want to do.  My final project at DBC was a <a href="http://redtreeproductions.gitub.io">game</a>, and I've been really leaning towards game programming, but I'm keeping my options open.</p>

        <p>I've been hired as a core coach at DBC which is pretty awesome.  Not only am I giving back to the school that gave me such an amazing experience, but its also giving me a chance to brush up on my Ruby skills.  It's been a lot of fun going back to Ruby algorithms, and it's been helping me get through some imposter syndrome realizing how much I really have learned.</p>

        <p>I do have a few projects in the works.  First and foremost is going to be giving this website a makeover. I made this back when my HTML and CSS skills were still pretty new. Next, my final project team, Red Tree Productions, is diving into making a MEAN stack mobile app.  I don't want to give too much info on the app yet, but I'll be keeping updates coming throughout the project.  We are also discussing another game, but we are still discussing what we want that game to be.</p>
