        <p>I'm on my final week of Phase 0 at DBC, and getting ready for my on campus experience.  As part of this preperation I'm looking into how to ask effective questions.  A lot of what I've been looking at is focused on asking questions online, but most of the ideas can be used for asking questions in person as well.</p>

        <p>One of the things that really annoys me with online questions is poor titles.  If you're browsing through a website, looking at recent questions, you dont want to see a question title that is like this: "I need help with Ruby."  I have no idea if I'm going to be able to help that person, or if the question is similar to a question I have.  Titles need to be specific to your question, such as "how do I select a specific array element in Ruby?"  Now when I'm browsing along I'm thinking "oh, I can help with that," or "I have a similar question."  Much more helpful.</p>

        <p>Applying this to in person questions: If you're working on something in a classroom or work setting, and you come to something where you have a question, you should be specific with your question when you approach somebody.  Lets say I approach someone with a question, such as the array question above.  Now they know right off if it's something they can help you with, or maybe they know someone who is better with that subject.  Approaching someone and saying "I'm having trouble with my code, can you help me?" doesn't give them any sort of idea on whether they can help you or not until they come to look at your code, which could potentially waste your time and theirs if they can't help you.</p>

        <p>Now that we've dealt with the title of the question, lets talk about the body.  Its important to include all the relevant data when you ask a question.  You should use code examples where necessary, if your're getting an output you don't want you should include that, and make sure you include the output you want.  That being said, don't include a lot of details that aren't important.  Lets flesh out what our array questions body might look like:</p>
        <p>I'm having a problem selecting a specific element in an array in Ruby.  My code looks like this:</p>

        <pre>
          my_array = ['tacos','pizza','hamburgers','steak','chili']

          puts my_array[1]
        </pre>

        <p>It keeps returning 'pizza', but I want it to return 'tacos'.</p>

        <p>Now we can see right away that the person is forgetting that array indexes start with 0, and we can answer the question easily.  Had they left out the code example, or the desired result, we might not have been able to know exactly what they were trying to ask.</p>

        <p>The last thing is to be courteous with both asking questions and answering them.  Make sure that you thank people for answering your questions (I can be bad about this online sometimes), and if someone comes to you with a question, understand that its not easy for a lot of people to admit they need help with something, and be kind and courteous with your answers.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading, I hope this helps some of you with your question asking abilities.  Now go forth and code.</p>
