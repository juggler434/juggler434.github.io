        <p>Javascript was first designed to be used with Netscape Navigator in 1995 by Brendan Eich.  Since then it as spread to one of the most widely used programming languages for front end development. The question is: why is Javasript so popular?</p>

        <p>Probaly the main reason that Javascript is so popular is that it is easy to learn.  While I don't think its as user friendly as Ruby, it is still very easy to learn the core concepts of Javascript and start using it right away.  Along the same lines, Javascript is also easy to edit.  Its a plain text language, and doesn't require a compiler to write, and can be edited with any plain text editor.  As Javascript has grown in popularity, the amount of resources, such as libraries or extension, has grown as well, helping build on the popularity even more.</p>

        <p>Javascript can do a lot of things, including modifying the HTML Dom tree, modifiying the CSS styings on a page, verifying information, and a whole lot of other stuff, but it is not without its limitations.  Probably the biggest limitation to Javascript is its inability to access databases.  Javascript by itself is a strictly front end language, and so to access the back end databases, it needs help from an outside source.  Also Javascript cannot access information from a website hosted on another domain.  This can actually be a good thing for security reasons, but it is a limitation to the language.</p>
