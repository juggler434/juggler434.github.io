      <p id="post-date">Posted August 31, 2014</p>
      <p>I just finished watching a video from the founder of Dev Bootcamp, Shereef Bishay, where he discussed some of the philosophy that surrounds the program.  It was an interesting video, and actually answered some of my questions and quelled some of my fears.</p>
      <p>Shereef made an interesting analogy during the video, comparing expectations to restaurants or kitchens.  The restaurant expectation is expecting everything to come packaged: you pay, you get your information, you get a job.  The kitchen on the other hand, is getting in, participating, and being part of the process.  It is really easy to fall into the restaurant mindset, and I have to admit, that I came into the program with that attitude.  However, I am really trying to get over that, and I want to put in as much effort as I can while I'm here, and participate in the whole DBC experiment.</p>
      <p>Another thing that stuck home with me is the fear of being not good enough.  Already I have seen some of my cohort mates seem to be light years ahead of me, and I have to admit I was a little intimidated by that.  Luckily, those people coming into the program with some knowledge have been really great about sharing that knowledge and answering questions, and seem to be ready to collaborate with anyone, so that is very helpful.  I have to keep in mind that we are all here to learn, and that it doesn't matter where we started or our background, but what we are doing here and now, and where we are going.</p>

      <p>I am really excited about what is happening here at Dev Bootcamp, and the program has really impressed me so far.  While at times I feel a little overwhelmed, this is something I know I can do, and I'm excited to do it.</p>
