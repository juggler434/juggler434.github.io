        <p id='date'>Posted August 30, 2014</p><!--date posted goes here-->
        <p>Looks like it's time to do my initial blog post for Dev Bootcamp!  For this post I will be taking a look and comparing several aspects of three different websites that I frequent. I'm going to go through a series of questions and answer them for each website.  The websites are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://fantasyflightgames.com">www.fantasyflightgames.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com">www.boardgamegeek.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a></li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Why is this one of your favorite sites?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantay Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>Fantasy Flight Games is one of my favorite websites for a few reasons.  One is that I am a fan of the company and the products that they release.  It is also a well laid out website that is nice to look at, and there is daily updates on upcoming products.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>Board Game Geek is one of my favorite websites for a very simple reason.  It is a place for people to discuss board games. It allows people to post fan made content, talk with designers, and discuss the hobby.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook.  Its great for keeping up with old friends, sharing photos and videos with people, and seeing what George Takei is posting.  On the other hand, it is notorious for continuing to give their users less and less privacy.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>What area of the website is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>On the Fantasy Flight Games website, my eye is immediatly drawn to a large scrolling advertisement of their latest games.  As a user, this isn't really the most important part of the website, but from the company's point of view, this is probably the most important part of the website.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>On the Board Game Geek webpage, my eye is drawn to two advertisements, one at the top of the page, and one on the right.  For me this is definately the least important part of the website.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>With Facebook, suprisingly, my eye isn't drawn to an advertisement initially.  When close to the screen, my eye is drawn to the top of my news feed.  When taking a step back, my eye is drawn to the list of my on-line friends on the right of the page.  As a user, these are the two most important parts of the webpage.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>How would you describe the website visually?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>The Fantasy Flight is very nicely laid out.  The website is very colorful with a lot of pictures and graphics.  Really the whole website is a giant advertisement for Fantasy Flight Games.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>Board Game Geek has a very outdated look.  The homepage is filled with links, the background is plain, and the homepage is terribly cluttered.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>Facebook has a simple layout that is easy to follow.  It keeps the colors to a minimum.  There are a lot adds on the page as you go through.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>What problem does the website solve?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>Fantasy Flights webpage really just serves as a giant advertisement for the company.  It also does contain some support for their games and a message board so that costumers can discuss products.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>Board Game Geek serves as the main meeting place for board game enthusiests.  It is essentially just a giant message board seperated into different sections, each devoted to a different game.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>Facebook is the largest social media website out there, and it lets people share content and keep up with each other.  It also allows companies to share updates, and a myriad of other types of information sharing.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>How easy is it to find what you are looking for on the Homepage?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>Fantasy Flight has a very easy homepage to follow.  There are clear buttons to the different sections of the website, as well as a news feed of recent posts on the website.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>Board Game Geek has a terrible Homepage.  It is extremely cluttered with links, the search bar does not pop out at you, and the search function is very picky.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>For the most part it is very easy to find what you are looking for on the Facebook Homepage.  The input bar and the search bar could probably be a little better labeled.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>How easy is it to browse all the content of the site?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>Fantasy Flights website is very easy to browse.  Probably the only complaint I have is the layout of the catalogue page, as it can be a little hard to find the game you are looking for.  That being said, its not really that bad, and the search function works pretty well.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>Board Game Geek gets a little easier to navigate once you get off the homepage, but its still no walk in the park.  The forum layout is terrible, and that is the main focus of the website.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>Facebook is allright for navigating around, I think it could be a little easier.  Its very hard to find something unless you know exactly what your looking for, but its functional.</p>
        </ul>
        <li><em>Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it and why?</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Fantasy Flight Games</em></li>
          <p>Yes, this website does sell products.  I have bought many products from the company, but never directly from the website.  I usually use the website to see what products are coming out and buy from local retailers.</p>
          <li><em>Board Game Geek</em></li>
          <p>This website doesn't sell anything directly.  This is the site that I usually use to research board games before buying them.</p>
          <li><em>Facebook</em></li>
          <p>Facebook doesn't sell any products directly.</p>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>So here we have three very different websites, that are good and bad for different reasons.  Fantasy Flight is a very pretty advertising site, while Board Game Geek is an ugly site that has terrible function, but really good content, and Facebook, which is a good balance of design and function.</p><!--Main post goes here-->
