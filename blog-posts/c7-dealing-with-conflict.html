        <p>As human beings, we are surrounded by conflict.  Conflict can be as large as full scale wars or as small as a frustrated parent trying to get their child to put on a jacket.  While most of us attempt to avoid conflict as much as possible, it is not always possible.  When this happens, how we deal with these conflicts becomes very important.</p><!--Main post goes here-->

        <p>Here is an example from my life where a conflict was resolved badly, and some of my thoughts on what I could have done to make it better.  In this example, I was playing a video game with 5 other people on-line. (Note: Any names mentioned have been changed.)  We had been stuck on a particular challenge for several days with many, many failed attempts.  This particular challenge required all participants to not only have a certain amount of individual skill, but be able to communicate and work together.</p>

        <p>After a few failed attempts on the third day of trying, one player, let's call him Steve, became very frustrated and stopped communicating with the group.  As more attempts failed, people began asking why he wasn't talking, until he replied by snapping at another player.  Here's where things started to go downhill.  My response to the situation was to say "I don't want to do this if Steve is going to be a bitch."  That sent Steve on a tirade, calling all the other players out for their lack of skill.  We then quit for the night.</p>

        <p>After I had a moment to cool off, I sent Steve a message apologizing for my words.  Unfortunately at this point he removed me from his friends list, blocked me from any further communication, and dropped out of the group.  This is an example of a conflict that was poorly handled on both sides and has resulted in a friendship falling apart.  While the context of a video game might seem like a silly example, the scenario could easily be moved to a group project or activity.  The basic group dynamics are the same.</p>

        <p>So, what should I have done differently?  The most obvious is that I should not have lashed out verbally at Steve.  This did nothing except elevate what could have been a small, manageable conflict, into a much bigger one.  Second, I probably should have done something earlier when it was obvious that Steve was first getting frustrated.  Perhaps suggested a short break to let us all cool off, or postponed the run for another night.  I could see a situation brewing, but waited until things were falling apart to address it.</p>

        <p>Looking back at this experience, I learned a lot about where my faults lie in conflict resolution.  I need to work on keeping a level head, and not attacking others.  I need to be better at resolving issues before they escalate, and communicate in constructive ways.  Its unfortunate that a friendship was ruined because of something as trivial as a video game, but I'm coming out of the situation a better person.</p>
