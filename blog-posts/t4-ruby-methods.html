        <h2 id='blog-title'>Ruby Method #map</h2><!--blot title goes here-->
        <p id='date'>Posted September 17, 2014</p><!--date posted goes here-->
        <p>Today I'm going to be taking a look at a really useful Enumerator method in Ruby, #map.  #map is used on an array to execute a given block on the array and return a new array with the results.  I know, that sounds complicated, but its really not and here are a few example of how to use it.</p><!--Main post goes here-->
        <pre> my_array = [1,2,3,4]
 my_array.map{ |x| x * 2 }
 =>[2,4,6,8]
        </pre>
        <p>See, that wasn't so bad.  All #map did was go over every element of the array, and multiply it by two, like our block told it to do.  Now the thing about #map is, it's non-destructive.  This means that our original array is in tact.  So lets take a look at what that means in an example:</p>
            <pre> my_array = [1,2,3,4]
 my_array.map{ |x| x * 2 }
 print my_array
 [1,2,3,4]
        </pre>
        <p>So here we can see that the my_array variable is still the same, even though we called #map on it.  If we want to make the #map method destructive, all we have to do is add a ! (or bang) to it, and it will now replace our original array with our modified results.  Lets get our example from above again, and this time make it destructive.</p>
      <pre> my_array = [1,2,3,4]
 my_array.map!{ |x| x * 2 }
 print my_array
 [2,4,6,8]
        </pre>

        <p>There we have it, we've replaced my_array with our results!</p>
        <p>At this point you might be asking yourself "what's the difference between #map and #each?"  Thats a good question, and I'm going to try and explain it.  #each performs the block of code on each element of the array, and then returns the original list, while #map performs the block of text on each element of the array and returns a new array with the results.  I can see you scratching your head so lets go back to some examples:
          <pre> my_array = [1,2,3,4]
 print my_array.each { |x| x * 2 }
 [1,2,3,4]
 my_array.each { |x| print (x * 2)}
 2468
 print my_array.map { |x| x * 2 }
 [2,4,6,8]
 print my_array
 [1,2,3,4]
       </pre>

       <p>There you have it! You now know about the #map method in Ruby, and how its different than #each.  #map is very useful, and in just a short time I've used it a lot.  Now go forth and code!</p>
