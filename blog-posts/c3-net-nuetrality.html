        <p>There is a debate raging in the United States right now about Net Neutrality.  The idea of net neutrality is that internet service providers (ISPs from here on out) and governments should treat all information on the internet equally.  The issue is of course much more complicated than that, but that is the gist of it.</p><!--Main post goes here-->

        <p>The argument for net neutrality is pretty obvious, ISPs should not be able to block or slow down certain content.  This will stop them from allowing bigger companies to pay extra money for faster speed, leaving smaller companies and startups in the dust.  It would also help ISPs from blocking competitors progress.</p>

        <p>There are some arguments against net neutrality however.  Opponents claim that net neutrality laws are taking control away from businesses and putting instead in the hands of the government.  There is also the idea that smaller companies will have the option to pay less, since they will probably not need the amount of bandwith that, say Netflix needs.</p>

        <p>Right now, one of the biggest problems with a non-neutral internet is choice.  Most people do not have much of a choice when it comes to ISPs.  If your current ISP is blocking or slowing content that you want access too, many times you don't have a choice to simply switch over.  Even moreso if your ISP is blocking access to competitors websites.  The answer here would seem to be to create more competition in the market place.  If consumers had a choice between ISPs, then they would obviously choose the ISP that gave them the most content for their money.  This is not an easy thing to accomplish however, as companies like Verizon and Comcast are laying the cable and providing the service, having more competition is becoming less likely instead of the other way around.</p>

        <p>Right now, its most important to keep the discussion going.  Change happens slowly, and the internet is still a brave new world.  Keep talking, right to your congress people, post articles.  Know that decissions made one way or the other aren't permanent.</p>
