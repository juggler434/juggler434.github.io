        <p>During Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, a large emphasis is put on pair programming, specifically driver/navigator pairing.  Pair programming is an interesting experience, and changes my whole approach to coding whenever I'm doing it.</p><!--Main post goes here-->
        <p>Before every pairing session I'm always nervous.  I guess it comes from a lot of different thoughts; "What if they're way better than me? What if their way worse than me?  What if we just don't click at all?  What if they think I'm stupid? "  It's not logical, since I've never had a negative experience while pair programming, but those thoughts are always swimming around up there before every pairing session.</p>
        <p>During pairing sessions the nervous feelings go away, but I get very aware of times when I'm not saying or doing anything.  With remote pairing, you can't see what your partner is doing or vice versa, so when I'm looking something up on the web or in my notes, I become very aware that it could appear that I'm not doing anything at all.  I also tend to work out a lot of problems in my head, so getting used to communicating that thought process verbally can be somewhat of a challenge.</p>

      <p>After pair programming sessions I almost always come out having learned something new.  It might not necessarily be directly about coding, but having that exchange of ideas with another person can open up new doors that I didn't know were there.  Even if I already know the material, talking it through with someone else can help solidify those concepts.</p>

      <p>Probably the hardest part about pair programming for me is leaving feedback.  I really have to get into a mindset where if I'm leaving constructive criticisms, it's to help that person with future projects.  I know that I appreciate the feedback I receive.  Its very difficult to know exactly where your shortcomings are, and having other people kindly point them out for you can help make you a better coder.  All that doesn't mean that it's easy to give others criticism, even if it is kind.</p>
