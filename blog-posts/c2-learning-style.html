        <p>Before I started at Dev Bootcamp I was asked to determine my <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Grecorc learning style.</a> As it turns out I am strongly in the linear abstract learning style.  What does this mean?  It means that I think of things in a step by step fashion, and I tend to use intuition and imagination instead of concrete details.</p>

        <p>Already I have began to see some advantages and disadvantages with this thinking style.  Linear thinking is somewhat similar to how code operates, and so I think it is helpful to think that way.  I have a problem, and I go step by step to find the solution to that problem.  I could see non-linear thinking being quite useful as well, allowing you to seperate a problem into chunks and work on those chunks in any order is a skill that I would definately like to develop.</p><!--Main post goes here-->

        <p>With the abstract thinking style, I sometimes have trouble learning concepts from just reading about them in articles.  Often times a concept will not make sense until I can get in and mess with it.  This can mean a lot of time I'm going back and forth with material, re-referencing things that I have already read.  There are some definite advantages to abstract thinking however.  I tend to be able to think outside the box when coming up with solutions, and I find that there are some problems that call for that kind of mindset.</p>

        <p>To help me in my Phase 0 studies, I think the best thing I can do is try concepts out right away as I'm learning them.  If I can get in devtools or a text editor and try stuff out right away, I think it will help solidify concepts as I go, instead of doing a lot of reading and then having to go back and reference it all over again.</p>

        <p>One thing that DBC has been helping me with a lot is keeping a growth mindset vs. a  fixed mindset.  A growth mindset allows you to learn and grow, take on challenges, and accept constructive criticism, while a fixed mindset will cause you to avoid challenges and be defensive in the face of criticism.  I have definitely noticed fixed mindset behaviors in myself in the past (I think we are all guilty of that from time to time), but DBC is a huge challenge, and I'm facing it head on and loving every minute of it.  There are times when I catch myself slipping into a fixed mindset, but I try to catch myself before it can settle in.</p>

        <p>It can be a hard thing to take an honest look at your own thinking style, but it can really help you determine the best learning environment for you, and I really appreciate the emphasis that DBC puts on this aspect of the learning process.</p>
