        <p>This week I've been taking a look at stereotype threat.  Most of the resources on the subject are by a psychologist named Claude Steele, and he came up with some pretty interesting results.  The example he used was women in math.  Sterotypically women don't perform as well as men at high level math.  He gave a high level test to an equal amount of males and females and the results seemed to mirror the stereotype.  Then, he gave the same test to a second group of people, but told the women that this test was adjusted to take out the gender bias, and the women's performance shot way up.  Just the existance of that negative stereotype had a huge impact on women's test scores.</p>

        <p>My degree is actually in classical music, and you would be amazed at the stereotypes that exist within the classical music world;  brass players are partiers, violinists are divas, percussionists are dumb, vocalists can't do music theory, ect.  While these stereotypes are not as deeply ingrained as racial or gender stereotypes, its interesting to look at them in the context of a mini-society.  Looking back, perhaps many of the vocalists who suffered through music theory were really facing stereotype threat.  Maybe the percussionists were barely passing their classes for the same reason.  Its interesting to think about.</p>

        <p>As I'm coming into the tech world, a big topic of discussion right now seems to be a lack of diversity in the industry.  The tech industry appears to be dominated by white males.  While diversity quotas can be created, that doesn't fix the problem of creating an atomosphere that is accepting and comforting.  Really, I think awareness is the first step.  Be aware of the information, and then try to catch yourself making unfair judgements based on a stereotype.  The more people begin to do this, the better the world will be.</p>
