        <p>When looking at other people, I believe we see them for their actions.  When we look at ourselves, we see our values.  I've been thinking about the values that I hold most dear, and what I do to live up to them.</p>

        <p>Probably the value that is most important to me is friendship.  I am the most happy when I am surrounded by friends, and I like to do things to make them happy.  Despite this, when I'm feeling down, I tend to isolate myself from those friendships.  When ranking my efforts to live up to this value from 1 to 5, I would say I fall around a 3 at the moment.  Friendships are kind of taking a back seat to school.</p>

        <p>Another value I hold dear is knowledge.  I love to be learning new things.  When I'm at a job, I want to be learning things constantly.  This can be both a blessing and a curse.  Sometimes I move on to new things too quickly, meaning there are many things that I never reach a true mastery of.  For example, I'm a juggler, and often I never learn the harder tricks that take a lot of time, because I would rather be learning a lot of other tricks.  When ranking my efforts to live up to this value from 1 to 5, right now I would say I'm at a 5.  I quit my job to go learn a new skill I've never done before.</p>

        <p>The last thing, and this one is kind of hard to admit about myself, is that I value my status.  I like being the guy people come to with questions.  I like being the best at something.  I'm not sure whether I can really call this a value, it might just be ego, but I'm going to try and see this in a positive light, even though sometimes it stops me from taking on new challenges because I don't want to look bad.  When ranking my efforts to live up this value from 1 to 5, I would say I'm at a 4.  Learning something completely new is humbling, but ultimately, it will improve my status.</p>

        <p>Stereotype threat is an ever present danger in our society, and our values can help to overcome it or succumb to it.  When looking at my own values, friendship and knowledge can both be powerful tools to overcome stereotype threat.  Knowing that you have people who care about you and believe in you no matter what can be very empowering; being very knowledgeable in a subject matter can help alleviate doubt.  I think status is more of a double edged sword here.  While it can be a powerful motivator, it can also cause you not to try new things.</p>

        <p>Its a tough thing to try and evaluate your own values.  I think self awareness is a huge part of having high emotional intelligence, so its good to do these introspective exercises.  I'm often finding things out about myself that I didn't know (or wouldn't admit) before.</p>
