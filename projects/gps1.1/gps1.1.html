            <h1>What is pair programming?</h1>
            <p>Pair programming is collaborating with another person on a project.
            There are several differernt ways to pair program, the model that
            is focused on in Dev Bootcamp is Driver/Navigator.</p>

            <h1>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h1>
            <p>DBC is a collaborative model for training programmers which makes
            it a perfect place to use a pair prgramming model. To paraphrase Shereef; if we aren't all invested
                in this together, it won't be as awesome. OK. That is a terrible paraphrase, but the underlying point
                is that we are better and more effective developers if we work together.
            </p>
            <p>By working collaboratively we help one another fill in 'blank spots' in our understanding
                while building trust.

            <p>Pair programming is useful in many ways.  It can really help with
            the understanding of a subject, and allows you to practice working on a team.
            Also, many times having a second perspective on something can make
            fixing probelems happen faster and easier.</p>
