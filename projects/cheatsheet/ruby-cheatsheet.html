        <span class = "cell">*</span>
        <span class = "cell">* can be used with numbers to multiply them.  It can also be used with a string and a number to repeat the string that many times.  However, you cannot use this with a string and a string.</span>
        <span class = "cell">/</span>
        <span class = "cell">/ can be used ot divide numbers.  If integers are given, the result will be rounded down to the nearest integer.</span>

        <span class = "cell">Array Position</span>
        <span class = "cell">You can call on specific parts of an array by position.  Position starts at 0.  Ex my_array = [1, 4, 5] my_array[0] is 1</span>
        <span class = "cell">Hash values</span>
        <span class = "cell">You can get or set a hash value by calling its key.  Ex. my_hash = {'one' => 1, 'twelve' => 12} my_hash['one'] is 1</span>
